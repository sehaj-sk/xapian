Task - 1 : Understanding and making the documentation
           Have added the doc in /xapian-core/docs folder with name as
           "queryparser_new.rst"

Task - 2 : Initially made some suggestions about the possible additions in
           Xapian QueryParser syntax on the basis of syntax which were
           available in other places. The file is placed in
           xapian-core/queryparser folder with name as "suggestions.rst".

           Then as Olly suggested, devoted quite some time to see what happens
           to the real world queries present in queryparsertest.cc once,
           after disabling the “re-parse with fags off” code. Made a
           list of the queries which gave error. There were around 130 or
           so such queries.
           The files are placed in a new folder named "report" present in the
           main directory with the name of files - "error_report_details.txt"
           and "summary.txt".
           Have made two plain text files -

           1st one (named "error_report_details.txt", is quite a big file,
           with all the plain text) contains
           all the queries
           from the real-world queries present in queryparsertest.cc which
           gave error
           while disabling the re-parse with no flags code., in order of
           their appearance
           in queryparsertest.cc.  With each query, following things are
           mentioned -

            1.  Query object returned when parsed with no flags.
            2.  The tokens produced by parsing the query with no flags
            3.  The tokens produced by parsing the query with flags
            4.  The reason of parse error for the particular query.

           2nd one (named "summary.txt") is the summary file, and is small
           too, made on the basis of
           the 1st file. It contains the information about the parser errors,
           grouped together along with the examples of queries which are not
           parsed because of those parser errors.

           Looked into the lucene source-code and got to know about the
           lucene query syntax and its lexer and parser.
           Found out how lucene handles the errors which were found on
           the basis of above task (those which are mentioned in summary.txt)
           and have written the findings in a plain text file called
           "lucene_findings.txt" plcaed in /report.
